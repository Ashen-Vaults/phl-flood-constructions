## Purpose

This is a data science project that will investigate proposed construction sites that are located on known flood plains in Philadelphia.
In doing this, I hope to spot potentially dangerious construction projects that could lead to human suffering if flooding were to occur. 
The tools that will be used are python3 in conjuction with jupyter notebooks. 
All data will be collected from https://www.opendataphilly.org/
